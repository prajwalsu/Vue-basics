Assignment 1 (19/9/22)
=========================================
1.what is  VUE.js?
==> Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. 
It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and 
component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, 
be it simple or complex.

2.Why should we choose VUE.js?
==>  -Enhancing static HTML without a build step
	-Embedding as Web Components on any page
	-Single-Page Application (SPA)
	-Fullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
	-Jamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)
	-Targeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal

3.What is Single Page  Applications
==>The page that handles data updates and navigation without having to reload to the page.

4.Events in Vue(5  examples)
==> *INLINE HANDLERS.
//in app//
    data() {
  return {
    count: 0
  }
}
//in html//
<button @click="count++">Add 1</button>
<p>Count is: {{ count }}</p>

*METHOD HANDLERS
//in app//
data() {
  return {
    name: 'Vue.js'
  }
},
methods: {
  greet(event) {
    // `this` inside methods points to the current active instance
    alert(`Hello ${this.name}!`)
    // `event` is the native DOM event
    if (event) {
      alert(event.target.tagName)
    }
  }
}

//in html//
<!-- `greet` is the name of the method defined above -->
<button @click="greet">Greet</button>

5.What are VUE directives (explain 5 directives)
==> Directives are instruction for VueJS to do things in a certain way.
v-on===clicking on button
v-once===it will return only one constant data


6.Example of two way binding
==> //in html//
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello world</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
</head>

<body>
     <div id="first">
         <h1>First VUE application</h1>
         <h2>{{greeting}}</h2>

         <h2>Person name is: {{person.name}} </h2>

         <!-- we can call the function
        we can write mathematical call
    we can not writecomplex if else condition -->

    <!-- <h3>{{1+4}} -->

        <!-- using v-html directive to read the raw html -->
        <h3 v-html="randomOutput()"></h3> 
     </div>

     <script src="./app.js"></script>
     
     <script src="./fetch.js"></script>
</body>

</html>

//in app//
let app = Vue.createApp({
    data() {
        return {
            email: ""
        }
    },
    
    methods:{
        // //setName(event) {
        //     this.email=event.target.value
        // },
        reset(){
            this.email=""
        }
    }
})
app.mount('#dataBinding')

Assignment 2 (20/9/22)
=====================================================

1.Explain v-once, v-html, v-if, v-else,
v-show,v-bind,v-model,v-show

==> //v-once- Render the element and component once only, and skip future updates.

 -Does not expect expression

 -Details

  On subsequent re-renders, the element/component and all its children will be
  treated as static content and skipped. This can be used to optimize update performance.

//v-html- Update the element's innerHTML.

Expects: string

//v-if- Conditionally render an element or a template fragment based on the 
truthy-ness of the expression value.

Expects: any

V-if more preror than v-for

//v-else- Denote the "else block" for v-if or a v-if / v-else-if chain.
can be used in template

Does not expect expression

//v-show- Toggle the element's visibility based on the truthy-ness of t
he expression value.

Expects: any

//v-bind -Dynamically bind one or more attributes, or a component prop to an expression.

Shorthand: : or . (when using .prop modifier)

Expects: any (with argument) | Object (without argument)

//v-model -Create a two-way binding on a form input element or a component.

Expects: varies based on value of form inputs element or output of components

Limited to:

<input>
<select>
<textarea>
components



2.Iterate through array using v-for and display in list format (5 examples)
==> 

3.Explain computed properties
==> 
In-template,  expressions are very convenient, but they are meant for simple operations. 
So we use computed properties it will maintain the hard code.
for complex logic that includes reactive data, it is recommended to use a computed property. 

4.Explain watchers
==>we can use the watch option to trigger a function whenever a reactive property changes.

in the cases where we need to perform "side effects" in reaction to state changes


Deep Watchers-watch is shallow by default: 
the callback will only trigger when the watched property has been assigned a new value -
it won't trigger on nested property changes. 
If you want the callback to fire on all nested mutations, you need to use a deep watcher:

5.What is ref? why to use it?
==>ref is a special attribute, similar to the key attribute in the v-for. 
It allows us to obtain a direct reference to a specific DOM element or child component instance after it's mounted.

6.Explain all the lifecycle methods
==>
LIFE CYCLE METHODS
====================

3 phases
-----------
1.MOUNTING
2.UPDATING
3.UNMOUNTING

1.Mounting

beforeCreate
-------------
Called when the instance is initialized.

Called immediately when the instance is initialized, after props resolution, before processing other options such as data() or computed:

created
----------
Called after the instance has finished processing all state-related options.

Details

When this hooks is called, the following have been set up: reactive data, computed properties, methods, and watchers.
However, the mounting phase has not been started, and the $el property will not be available yet.

beforeMount
------------
Called right before the component is to be mounted.

Details

When this hook is called, the component has finished setting up its reactive state, but no DOM nodes have been created yet. 
It is about to execute its DOM render effect for the first time.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.

mounted (api calls)
----------
Called after the component has been mounted.

Details

A component is considered mounted after:

All of its synchronous child components have been mounted (does not include async components or components inside <Suspense> trees).

Its own DOM tree has been created and inserted into the parent container. 
Note it only guarantees that the component's DOM tree is in-document if the application's root container is also in-document.

This hook is typically used for performing side effects that need access to the component's rendered DOM,
 or for limiting DOM-related code to the client in a server-rendered application.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering



2.Update phase
================

beforeUpdate
--------------
Called right before the component is about to update its DOM tree due to a reactive state change.

Details

This hook can be used to access the DOM state before Vue updates the DOM.
It is also safe to modify component state inside this hook.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.

updated
---------------
Called after the component has updated its DOM tree due to a reactive state change.

Details

A parent component's updated hook is called after that of its child components.

This hook is called after any DOM update of the component, 
which can be caused by different state changes. 
If you need to access the updated DOM after a specific state change, use nextTick() instead.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.


3.Unmount Phase
================

beforeUnmount
----------------
Called right before a component instance is to be unmounted.

Details

When this hook is called, the component instance is still fully functional.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.

unmounted
------------------
Called after the component has been unmounted.

Details

A component is considered unmounted after:
---------------------------------------------
All of its child components have been unmounted.

All of its associated reactive effects (render effect and computed / watchers created during setup()) have been stopped.

Use this hook to clean up manually created side effects such as timers, DOM event listeners or server connections.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.

7.create 5 projects

==========================================
Assignement 3 (21/9/22)
==========================================

1.What are props?
==> “Props” is a special keyword which stands for properties.
 It can be registered on a component to pass data from a parent component to one of its children components.

2.send data from parent to child (3 ex)

3.send data from child to parent(5 ex)

4.How to validatte props?(3 ex)
==>Components can specify requirements for their props, such as TYPE in React.
 If a requirement is not met, Vue will warn you in the browser's JavaScript console.
 This is especially useful when developing a component that is intended to be used by others.

 To specify prop validations, you can provide an object with validation requirements to the props option, 
 instead of an array of strings.     

5.conditional rendering(3 ex)
==>CONDITIONAL RENDERING
======================
The directive v-if 
-------------------
it is used to conditionally render a block. 
The block will only be rendered if the directive's expression returns a truthy value.


v-else
-------
You can use the v-else directive to indicate an "else block" for v-if

A v-else element must immediately follow a v-if or a v-else-if element - otherwise it will not be recognized.

v-else-if
-----------
The v-else-if, as the name suggests, serves as an "else if block" for v-if. 
It can also be chained multiple times

6.How  to avoid props drilling?

7.Explain provide and inject?
==> Usually, when we need to pass data from the parent to a child component, we use props.
   If we have a large component tree, and a deeply nested component needs something from a distant ancestor component. 
   With only props, we would have to pass the same prop across the entire parent chain:
  
   If there is a longer parent chain, more components would be affected along the way. This is called "props drilling" 
                                                                                                      ------------------
   To avoid the prop drilling we use Provide and Inject.

   A parent component can serve as a dependency provider for all its descendants. 
   Any component in the descendant tree, regardless of how deep it is, 
   can inject dependencies provided by components up in its parent chain.

9.Revise all the previous concepts

==========================================
Assignment 4 (22/9/22)
==========================================
1.What are dynamic components and how to create dynamic components?
==>Vue dynamic components enable users to switch between two or more components without routing, 
and even retain the state of data when switching back to the initial component. 
The central idea is to let users dynamically mount and unmount components in the user interface without using routers.

//code in app.vue

<template>
  <router-link to="/">Home</router-link>
  <button @click="createComponent">Create Component</button>

  <router-view></router-view>
</template>

<script>
import { getCurrentInstance } from "vue";
import { useRouter } from "vue-router";
export default {
  name: "App",
  setup() {
    const app = getCurrentInstance().appContext.app;
    const router = useRouter();

    const createComponent = () => {
      // Check if the component has been alreadey registered
      if (!app.component("NewComponent")) {
        app.component("NewComponent", {
          name: "NewComponent",
          template: `
        <div>This is a new component</div>
        `,
        });
      }

      const newComponent = app.component("NewComponent");
      // Adding a new route to the new component
      router.addRoute({ path: "/new", component: newComponent });

      router.push("/new");
    };
    return {
      createComponent,
    };
  },
};
</script>

<style>
</style>


2.Expalin <Keep-alive>?
==> a component will be unmounted when it is switched away from that component. 
 We can force the inactive components to stay "alive" with the built-in <KeepAlive> component.

3.How to scope the style in a component?
==>When a <style> tag has the scoped attribute, its CSS will apply to elements of the current component only. 
This is similar to the style encapsulation found in Shadow DOM.

4.creatte a form with custom validation

5.create a form by using VeeValidate with proper validation

6.Explain code splitting and lazy loading
==>Code splitting is where a tool splits the application bundle into multiple smaller chunks, which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel.
